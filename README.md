# jull-io

jull.io is a processing back-end and API for the mosca MQTT broker.

### What can you do with it? 

You can turn anything into a real-time geo-aware thing, giving it the 
ability to detect the proximity of other things, know when it arrive or leave a 
place and broadcast messages. The API gives you a detailed storyline that shows 
where, when, and how much your thing moves, along with sensor readings, speed, 
duration and distance statistics.
